            <h1>Bibliography</h1>
            <p>Dante Alighieri, baptized as Durante di Alighiero degli Alighieri, was born between late May to late June 1265 in Florence, Italy. Dante is commonly referred to as the “Father” of the Italian language. He was instrumental in establishing literature in Italy, influencing notable English writers such as John Milton and Geoffrey Chaucer, and is attributed with the creation of the three-line rhyme scheme, terza rima. Most importantly, his interpretations of Hell, Purgatory and Heaven as explored in the three part poem, the Divine Comedy, which has influenced Western art and literature that leaves a lasting impact even after 700 years!</p>

        <h1>Early Years</h1>
        <p>Dante was born in Florence in 1265, most information about Dante’s immediate family comes from Dante himself and historical records. It can be suggested that Dante was born into a wealthy family, as his father, Aighiero de Bellincione was a White Guelph who did not suffer any consequences of the Battle of Montaperti, along with how Dante is usually depicted in red, a color associated highly in hierarchy and meant to be taken seriously. Dante’s mother died when he was young and his father may have remarried, but is confirmed that he had two children with another woman.   </p>

        <h1>Marriage and Loyalty</h1>
        <p>Dante was promised to be married to Gemma di Manetto Donati, which was a common occurance during his time, however Dante’s true love resided in a woman named, Beatrice Portinari. Dante claims that he had fallen in love at first sight without  talking to her. This continued until a few years after his marriage with Gemma, where Dante claims that he never met Beatrice again.

            Dante had a profound loyalty to his birth city of Florence as well. He fought in the Guelph cavalry during the Battle of Campaldino in 1289 and was recorded to participated in speaking and voting in various councils of the republic up until 1300.

        <h1>Public Career</h1>
        <p>Dante presumably studied at home or in a school connected with the church or monastery in Florence. It is known that he had admired Tuscan poetry. He later went into philosophical studies.

            Dante’s interest in philosophy began, as he wrote, as he was trying to find peace after the death of Beatrice, however what started as reprieve from despair, began to take a hold as an important part of Dante’s career</p>

        <h1>Politics and Exile</h1>
        <p>Dante, like most Florentines, was apart of the Guelph-Ghibelline conflict, assisting and fighting in political matters over the years while he was held in office. After the defeat of the Ghibellines, the Guelphs divided into two, the White Guelphs and the Black Guelphs, although the split were along family lines, soon ideological differences rose among the groups as both fought to gain control of Florence. During one conflict which the Black Guelphs seized control, they ordered Dante to pay a fine and was forced into exile for 2 years. Dante refused to pay as he believed he did not do anything wrong and was sentenced to perpetual exile, if he had returned to Florence at any time, he could have been burned at the stake for it.</p>

        <h1>Death and After</h1>
        <p>Dante’s last years were spent in Ravenna where he was invited by its prince of the time, Guido II da Polenta, which is where he would die on September 14, 1321 around the age of 56, he would be buried at Church of San Pier Maggiore.

            Dante would remain a controversial figure as in 1329, Pope John XXII classified Dante’s work, Monarchia, as heretical and sought to have his bones burned at the stake. Over the years, Florence began to regret exiling Dante and repeatedly requested for his remains to be returned, which continued until 2008 where the Municipality of Florence officially apologized for exiling Dante and in 2021, a virtual re-trial was held to posthumously clear his name, which brings us to today.</p>

            <h2>ULTRAKILL (2020)</h2>
            <p>Ultrakill, created by Hakita and published by New Blood Interactive, has an army of blood-driven robots descend into Hell on a rampage as the blood supplies on the surface have been drained. This game takes inspiration from Inferno as each layer is represented throughout the main course of the game.</p>
            <img src="images/uk-greed.jpg" alt="greed-layer">
            <p>The game differs from Inferno in the aesthetics and punishments in some of the layers, for example in Greed, as opposed to Dante’s interpretation of spenders and hoarders constantly fighting in a huge pit. Ultrakill’s interpretation has sinners carry large boulders on their backs and forced to climb monuments of mankind’s greed for all eternity. The desert consists entirely out of gold dust which scorches the feet of the sinners as they walk.</p>
