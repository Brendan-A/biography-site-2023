                <p>Dante was born in Florence in 1265, most information about Dante’s immediate family comes from Dante himself and historical records. It can be suggested that Dante was born into a wealthy family, as his father, Aighiero de Bellincione was a White Guelph who did not suffer any consequences of the Battle of Montaperti, along with how Dante is usually depicted in red, a color associated highly in hierarchy and meant to be taken seriously. Dante’s mother died when he was young and his father may have remarried, but is confirmed that he had two children with another woman.</p>
