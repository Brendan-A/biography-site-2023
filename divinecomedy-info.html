                <h1>The Divine Comedy</h1>
                <p>The Divine Comedy was written by Dante between 1308 and finished around 1321 shortly before his death and is widely considered both his best and most important work of literature, but also one of the greatest works of world literature. The Divine Comedy is split into three parts, Inferno, Purgatoriio, and Paradiso and focuses on Dante as he walks through afterlife and his journey through Hell, Purgatory and Heaven respectfully.</p>

                <p>The influence that the Divine Comedy has had on many ideas of the modern world such as a view on the afterlife, interpretations of Heaven and Hell, on creativity such as literature or artworks cannot be understated.</p>
