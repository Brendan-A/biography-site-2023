                <h1>Convivio</h1>
                <p>Convivio, which translates to 'The Banquet' is an unfinished work by Dante that was written somewhere between 1304 and 1307. The Convivio consists of four books, which is made up of a 'tratatti' which was treated as a beginning or introduction, and then followed by three books consisting of canzones and allegorical interpretation.</p>

                <p>The book serves as a gateway to see what the world was like during Dante's time as it touches on many areas such as learning, politics, sciences and history. It starts with Dante explaining why he was writing the book following up in Books 2 and 3 which both form a long story of Dante's new love after the death of Beatrice and ending with Book 4 that focusies on the nature of nobility.
