                <h1>La Vita Nuova</h1>
                <p>La Vita Nuova is a text by Dante that was published in 1294, it is defined by its expression of courtly love in prosimetrum style, which is a combination of both prose and verse. It has an esscence of an autobiography as it has an emphasis on Dante dealing with his love for Beautrice. The work contains 42 chapters and 25 sonnets, one ballata, and five canzones, with the last canzone being left as a reminder of Beatrice's death. La Vita Nuova left an impact by being written in Tuscan vernacular rather than Latin, which helped boost to establish Tuscan as a basis for the Italian Language. </p>
